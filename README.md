The Mobile Phone Pricing project aims to classify mobile phones into predefined price categories based on key specifications such as RAM, battery capacity, display size, processor performance, and other relevant features. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project provides valuable insights for manufacturers and retailers, helping them optimize pricing strategies and better target specific customer segments.

The project was implemented using Google Colab and involved data preprocessing techniques to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for training. Various machine learning algorithms were explored, and the most suitable classification algorithm was selected based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The classification model enhances pricing decisions by predicting the price category of a mobile phone based on its technical attributes.
